# Better-Cobble-Generation

I made this because you need massive cobble generators for the Create mod, and on servers they are very laggy. This aims to fix that by adding a mixing recipe so things are more compact, and so items aren't flying everywhere. That's all it really does.

To install the datapack version, just go into your world folder, then drag the zip file into the datapacks folder.
